\lab{Pandas I: Introduction}{Pandas I: Introduction}
\objective{Though NumPy and SciPy are powerful tools for numerical computing, they lack some of the high-level functionality necessary for many data science applications.
Python's \emph{pandas} library, built on NumPy, is designed specifically for data management and analysis.
In this lab, we introduce pandas data structures, syntax, and explore its capabilities for quickly analyzing and presenting data.
}
\label{lab:pandas1}

% Just as NumPy is built on the \li{ndarray} data structure suited for efficient
% scientific and numerical computation, pandas is centered around a handful of
% core data structures custom built for data analysis: the \li{Series}, \li{DataFrame}, and \li{Panel}, which roughly correspond to one, two, and three-dimensional arrays.
% The \li{Panel} data structure is not used nearly

\section*{Series} % ===========================================================

A pandas \li{Series} is generalization of a one-dimensional NumPy array.
Like a NumPy array, every \li{Series} has a data type (\li{dtype}), and the entries of the \li{Series} are all of that type.
Unlike a NumPy array, every \li{Series} has an \emph{index} that labels each entry, and a \li{Series} object can also be given a name to label the entire data set.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import pandas as pd

# Initialize a Series of random entries with an index of letters.
>>> pd.Series(np.random.random(4), index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
<<a    0.474170
b    0.106878
c    0.420631
d    0.279713
dtype: float64>>

# The default index is integers from 0 to the length of the data.
>>> pd.Series(np.random.random(4), name="uniform draws")
<<0    0.767501
1    0.614208
2    0.470877
3    0.335885
Name: uniform draws, dtype: float64>>
\end{lstlisting}

The index in a \li{Series} is a pandas object of type \li{Index} and is stored as the \li{index} attribute of the \li{Series}.
The plain entries in the \li{Series} are stored as a NumPy array and can be accessed as such via the \li{values} attribute.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> s1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], name="some ints")

>>> s1.values                           # Get the entries as a NumPy array.
<<array([1, 2, 3, 4])>>

>>> print(s1.name, s1.dtype, sep=", ")  # Get the name and dtype.
<<some ints, int64>>

>>> s1.index                            # Get the pd.Index object.
<<Index(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], dtype='object')>>
\end{lstlisting}

The elements of a \li{Series} can be accessed by either the regular position-based integer index, or by the corresponding label in the index.
New entries can be added dynamically as long as a valid index label is provided, similar to adding a new key-value pair to a dictionary.
A \li{Series} can also be initialize from a dictionary: the keys become the index labels, and the values become the entries.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> s2 = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=["apple", "banana", "carrot"])
>>> s2
<<apple     10
banana    20
carrot    30
dtype: int64>>

# s2[0] and s2["apple"] refer to the same entry.
>>> print(s2[0], s2["apple"], s2["carrot"])
<<10 10 30>>

>>> s2[0] += 5              # Change the value of the first entry.
>>> s2["dewberry"] = 0      # Add a new value with label 'dewberry'.
>>> s2
<<apple       15
banana      20
carrot      30
dewberry     0
dtype: int64>>

# Initialize a Series from a dictionary.
>>> pd.Series({"eggplant":3, "fig":5, "grape":7}, name="more foods")
<<eggplant    3
fig         5
grape       7
Name: more foods, dtype: int64>>
\end{lstlisting}

Slicing and fancy indexing also work the same way in \li{Series} as in NumPy arrays.
In addition, multiple entries of a \li{Series} can be selected by indexing a list of labels in the index.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> s3 = pd.Series({"lions":2, "tigers":1, "bears":3}, name="oh my")
>>> s3
<<bears     3
lions     2
tigers    1
Name: oh my, dtype: int64>>

# Get a subset of the data by regular slicing.
>>> s3[1:]
<<lions     2
tigers    1
Name: oh my, dtype: int64>>

# Get a subset of the data with fancy indexing.
>>> s3[np.array([len(i) == 5 for i in s3.index])]
<<bears    3
lions    2
Name: oh my, dtype: int64>>

# Get a subset of the data by providing several index labels.
>>> s3[ ["tigers", "bears"] ]
tigers    1                     # Note that the entries are reordered,
bears     3                     # and the name stays the same.
<<Name: oh my, dtype: int64>>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{comment} % Unnecessary, already getting too long.
We can create a \li{Series} having constant values in the following manner:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> val = 4     #desired constant value of Series
>>> n = 6       #desired length of Series
>>> s3 = pd.Series(val, index=np.arange(n))
>>> s3
0    4
1    4
2    4
3    4
4    4
5    4
dtype: int64
\end{lstlisting}
\end{comment}

\begin{problem}
Create a pandas \li{Series} where the index labels are the even integers $0,2,\ldots,50$, and the entries are $n^2 - 1$, where $n$ is the entry's label.
Set all of the entries equal to zero whose labels are divisible by $3$.
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Operations with Series} % ----------------------------------------

A \li{Series} object has all of the advantages of a NumPy array, including entry-wise arithmetic, plus a few additional features (see Table \ref{table:pandas-numerical-methods}).
Operations between a \li{Series} $S_1$ with index $I_1$ and a \li{Series} $S_2$ with index $I_2$ results in a new \li{Series} with index $I_1\cup I_2$.
In other words, the index dictates how two \li{Series} can interact with each other.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> s4 = pd.Series([1, 2, 4], index=['a', 'c', 'd'])
>>> s5 = pd.Series([10, 20, 40], index=['a', 'b', 'd'])
>>> 2*s4 + s5
<<a    12.0>>
<<b     NaN>>                           # s4 doesn't have an entry for b, and
<<c     NaN>>                           # s5 doesn't have an entry for c, so
<<d    48.0>>                           # the combination is Nan (np.nan / None).
<<dtype: float64>>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{r|l}

\li{mode()}    & The most common element(s) \\
\li{prod()}    & The product of the elements \\

% Methods marked with a * are not methods of NumPy's \li{ndarray} class.
}
\label{table:pandas-numerical-methods}
\end{table}

Many \li{Series} are more useful than NumPy arrays primarily because of their index.
For example, a \li{Series} can be indexed by time with a pandas \li{DatetimeIndex}, an index with date and/or time values.
The usual way to create this kind of index is with \li{pd.date_range()}.

\begin{lstlisting}
# Make an index of the first three days in July 2000.
>>> pd.date_range("7/1/2000", "7/3/2000", freq='D')
<<DatetimeIndex(['2000-07-01', '2000-07-02', '2000-07-03'],
                dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='D')>>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Suppose you make an investment of $d$ dollars in a particularly volatile stock.
Every day the value of your stock goes up by \$$1$ with probability $p$, or down by \$$1$ with probability $1-p$ (this is an example of a \emph{random walk}).

Write a function that accepts a probability parameter $p$ and an initial amount of money $d$, defaulting to $100$.
Use \li{pd.date_range()} to create an index of the days from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000.
Simulate the daily change of the stock by making one draw from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$ (a binomial distribution with one draw) for each day.
Store the draws in a pandas \li{Series} with the date index and set the first draw to the initial amount $d$.
Sum the entries cumulatively to get the stock value by day.
Set any negative values to $0$, then plot the series using the \li{plot()} method of the \li{Series} object.

Call your function with a few different values of $p$ and $d$ to observe the different possible kinds of behavior.
\label{prob:pandas-random-walk}
\end{problem}

\begin{info}
The \li{Series} in Problem \ref{prob:pandas-random-walk} is an example of a \emph{time series}, since it is indexed by time.
Time series show up often in data science; we will explore them in more depth in another lab.
\end{info}

\label{table:pandas-manage-data}
\end{table}

\section*{Data Frames} % ======================================================

A \li{DataFrame} is a collection of \li{Series} that share the same index, and is therefore a two-dimensional generalization of a NumPy array.
The row labels are collectively called the \emph{index}, and the column labels are collectively called the \emph{columns}.
An individual column in a \li{DataFrame} object is one \li{Series}.

There are many ways to initialize a \li{DataFrame}.
In the following code, we build a \li{DataFrame} out of a dictionary of \li{Series}.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> x = pd.Series(np.random.randn(4), ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
>>> y = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5), ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f'])
>>> df1 = pd.DataFrame({"series 1": x, "series 2": y})
>>> df1
<<   series 1  series 2
a -0.365542  1.227960
b  0.080133  0.683523
c  0.737970       NaN
d  0.097878 -1.102835
e       NaN  1.345004
f       NaN  0.217523>>
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the index of this \li{DataFrame} is the union of the index of \li{Series} \li{x} and that of \li{Series} \li{y}.
The columns are given by the keys of the dictionary \li{d}.
Since \li{x} doesn't have a label \li{e}, the
value in row \li{e}, column \li{1} is \li{NaN}.
This same reasoning explains the other missing values as well.
Note that if we take the first column of the \li{DataFrame} and drop the missing values, we recover the \li{Series} \li{x}:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> df1["series1"].dropna()
<<a   -0.365542
b    0.080133
c    0.737970
d    0.097878
Name: series 1, dtype: float64>>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{warn}
A pandas \li{DataFrame} cannot be sliced in exactly the same way as a NumPy array.
Notice how we just used \li{df1["series 1"]} to access a \emph{column} of the
the \li{DataFrame} \li{df1}.
We will discuss this in more detail later on.
\end{warn}

We can also initialize a \li{DataFrame} using a NumPy array, creating custom
row and column labels.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> data = np.random.random((3, 4))
>>> pd.DataFrame(data, index=['A', 'B', 'C'], columns=np.arange(1, 5))

            1	        2	        3	        4
A	 0.065646	 0.968593	 0.593394	 0.750110
B	 0.803829	 0.662237	 0.200592	 0.137713
C	 0.288801	 0.956662	 0.817915	 0.951016
3 rows     4 columns
\end{lstlisting}

As with Series, if we don't specify the index or columns, the default is
\li{np.arange(n)}, where \li{n} is either the number of rows or columns.

\begin{comment} % Not necessary here. Too much info.
It is also possible to create multi-indexed arrays, for example:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> grade=['eighth', 'ninth', 'tenth']
>>> subject=['math', 'science', 'english']
>>> myindex = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([grade, subject], names=['grade', 'subject'])
>>> myseries = pd.Series(np.random.randn(9), index=myindex)
>>> myseries
grade   subject
eighth  math       1.706644
        science   -0.899587
        english   -1.009832
ninth   math       2.096838
        science    1.884932
        english    0.413266
tenth   math      -0.924962
        science   -0.851689
        english    1.053329
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}

Multi-indexing is visually convenient, and will be explored further in Lab
\ref{lab:pandas3}, where we will discuss pandas pivot tables.

\section*{Viewing and Accessing Data}

In this section we will explore some elementary accessing and querying
techniques that enable us to maneuver through and gain insight into our data.
Try using the \li{describe()} and \li{head()} methods for quick data summaries.

\subsection*{Basic Data Access}

We can slice the rows of a \li{DataFrame} much as with a NumPy array.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(4, 2), index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
                      columns = ['I', 'II'])
>>> df[:2]

          I        II
a  0.758867  1.231330
b  0.402484 -0.955039

[2 rows x 2 columns]
\end{lstlisting}

More generally, we can select subsets of the data using the \li{iloc} and
\li{loc} indexers.
The \li{loc} index selects rows and columns based on
their \emph{labels}, while the \li{iloc} method selects them based on their
integer \emph{position}.
Accessing \li{Series} and \li{DataFrame} objects
using these indexing operations is more efficient than using bracket indexing, because the bracket indexing has to check many cases before it can determine how to slice the data structure.
Using \li{loc}/\li{iloc} explicitly, bypasses the extra checks.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> # select rows a and c, column II
>>> df.loc[['a','c'], 'II']

a    1.231330
c    0.556121
Name: II, dtype: float64

>>> # select last two rows, first column
>>> df.iloc[-2:, 0]

c   -0.475952
d   -0.518989
Name: I, dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, a column of a \li{DataFrame} may be accessed using simple square
brackets and the name of the column, or alternatively by treating the label
as an object:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> # get second column of df
>>> df['II']        # or, equivalently, df.II

a    1.231330
b   -0.955039
c    0.556121
d    0.173165
Name: II, dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}

All of these techniques for getting subsets of the data may also be used to set
subsets of the data:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> # set second columns to zeros
>>> df['II'] = 0
>>> df['II']
a    0
b    0
c    0
d    0
Name: II, dtype: int64

>>> # add additional column of ones
>>> df['III'] = 1
>>> df
            I  II  III
a   -0.460457   0    1
b    0.973422   0    1
c   -0.475952   0    1
d   -0.518989   0    1
\end{lstlisting}

% I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A PROBLEM HERE!!

\begin{comment} % Moved random walk to Series section.
\subsection*{Plotting}

Plotting is often a much more effective way to view and gain understanding of a dataset than simply viewing the raw numbers.
Fortunately, pandas interfaces well with matplotlib, allowing relatively
painless data visualization.

Most of the functionality of plotting using pandas will be discussed in Lab \ref{lab:pandas2}.
 In this lab, we will simply show how to plot a \li{Series}.
Doing so is easy, as the \li{Series} object is equipped with its own plot
function.
% Change this example to use the titanic data, which will be cleaned up.

Let's start with visualizing a simple random walk.
By way of background, a \emph{random walk} is a
stochastic process used to model a non-deterministic path through some space.
It is a useful construct in
many fields and can be used to explain things like the motion of a molecule as it travels through a liquid to modeling the fluctuations
of stock prices.
Here we will simulate a one-dimensional symmetric random walk on the integers, which can be
described as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start at 0.
  \item Flip a fair coin.
  \item If heads, move one unit to the right.
Otherwise, move one unit to the left.
  \item Go to Step 2.
\end{enumerate}
How can we simulate this random walk efficiently? Note that the walk is really characterized by the outcomes
of the coin flip.
If we represent heads by the number $1$ and tails by $-1$, then our position at a given moment
is just the cumulative sum of all previous outcomes.
Below, we simulate a sequence of coin flips, build the
resulting random walk, and plot the outcome.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> N = 1000        # length of random walk
>>> s = np.zeros(N)
>>> s[1:] = np.random.binomial(1, .5, size=(N-1,))*2-1 #coin flips
>>> s = pd.Series(s)
>>> s = s.cumsum()  # random walk
>>> s.plot()
>>> plt.ylim([-50, 50])
>>> plt.show()
>>> plt.close()
\end{lstlisting}

The random walk is shown in Figure \ref{fig:PandasRandomWalk}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7 \textwidth]{randomWalk.pdf}
\caption{Random walk of length 1000.}
\label{fig:PandasRandomWalk}
\end{figure}

\begin{problem}
Create five random walks of length 100, and plot them together in the same plot.

Next, create a ``biased'' random walk by changing the coin flip probability of head from 0.5 to 0.51.
Plot this biased walk with lengths 100, 10000, and then 100000.
Notice the definite trend that emerges.
Your results should be comparable to those in Figure \ref{pandas:biasedRandomWalk}.
\end{problem}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7 \textwidth]{biasedRandomWalk.pdf}
\caption{Biased random walk of length 100 (above) and 10000 (below).}

\end{figure}
\end{comment}

\section*{SQL Operations in pandas} % =========================================

The \li{DataFrame}, being a tabular data structure, bears an obvious resemblance to a typical relational
database table.
SQL is the standard for working with relational databases, and in this section we will
explore how pandas accomplishes some of the same tasks as SQL.
The SQL-like functionality of pandas is
one of its biggest advantages, since it can eliminate the need to switch between programming languages
for different tasks.
Within pandas we can handle both the querying \emph{and} data analysis.

For the following examples, we will use the following data:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> #build toy data for SQL operations
>>> name = ['Mylan', 'Regan', 'Justin', 'Jess', 'Jason', 'Remi', 'Matt', 'Alexander', 'JeanMarie']
>>> sex = ['M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'F']
>>> age = [20, 21, 18, 22, 19, 20, 20, 19, 20]
>>> rank = ['Sp', 'Se', 'Fr', 'Se', 'Sp', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'Se']
>>> ID = range(9)
>>> aid = ['y', 'n', 'n', 'y', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'y', 'n']
>>> GPA = [3.8, 3.5, 3.0, 3.9, 2.8, 2.9, 3.8, 3.4, 3.7]
>>> mathID = [0, 1, 5, 6, 3]
>>> mathGd = [4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0]
>>> major = ['y', 'n', 'y', 'n', 'n']
>>> studentInfo = pd.DataFrame({'ID': ID, 'Name': name, 'Sex': sex, 'Age': age, 'Class': rank})
>>> otherInfo = pd.DataFrame({'ID': ID, 'GPA': GPA, 'Financial_Aid': aid})
>>> mathInfo = pd.DataFrame({'ID': mathID, 'Grade': mathGd, 'Math_Major': major})
\end{lstlisting}

Before querying our data, it is important to know some of its basic properties,
such as number of columns, number of rows, and the datatypes of the columns.
This can be done by simply calling the \li{info()} method on the desired
\li{DataFrame}:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> mathInfo.info()
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Int64Index: 5 entries, 0 to 4
Data columns (total 3 columns):
Grade         5 non-null float64
ID            5 non-null int64
Math_Major    5 non-null object
dtypes: float64(1), int64(1), object(1)
\end{lstlisting}

We can also get some basic information about the structure of the \li{DataFrame}
using the \li{head()} or \li{tail()} methods.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> mathInfo.head()
   Grade  ID Math_Major  ID  Age  GPA
0    4.0   0          y   0   20  3.8
1    3.0   1          n   2   18  3.0
2    3.5   5          y   4   19  2.8
3    3.0   6          n   6   20  3.8
4    4.0   3          n   7   19  3.4
\end{lstlisting}

The method \li{isin()} is a useful way to find certain values in a
\li{DataFrame}.
 It compares the input (a list, dictionary, or \li{Series})
to the \li{DataFrame} and returns a boolean \li{Series} showing whether or
not the values match.
You can then use this boolean array to select appropriate
locations.
Now let's look at the pandas equivalent of some SQL SELECT statements.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> # SELECT ID, Age FROM studentInfo
>>> studentInfo[['ID', 'Age']]

>>> # SELECT ID, GPA FROM otherInfo WHERE Financial_Aid = 'y'
>>> otherInfo[otherInfo['Financial_Aid']=='y'][['ID', 'GPA']]

>>> # SELECT Name FROM studentInfo WHERE Class = 'J' OR Class = 'Sp'
>>>  studentInfo[studentInfo['Class'].isin(['J','Sp'])]['Name']
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
The example above shows how to implement a simple WHERE condition, and it is easy
to have a more complex expression.
Simply enclose each condition by parentheses,
and use the standard boolean operators \li{\&} (AND), \li{\|} (OR), and \li{\~} (NOT) to
connect the conditions appropriately.
Use pandas to execute the following query:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
SELECT ID, Name from studentInfo WHERE Age > 19 AND Sex = 'M'
\end{lstlisting}
\end{problem}

Next, let's look at JOIN statements.
In pandas, this is done with the \li{merge} function,
which takes as arguments the two \li{DataFrame} objects to join, as well as keyword arguments specifying
the column on which to join, along with the type (left, right, inner, outer).

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> # SELECT * FROM studentInfo INNER JOIN mathInfo ON studentInfo.ID = mathInfo.ID
>>> pd.merge(studentInfo, mathInfo, on='ID') # INNER JOIN is the default
   Age Class  ID    Name Sex  Grade Math_Major
0   20    Sp   0   Mylan   M    4.0          y
1   21    Se   1   Regan   F    3.0          n
2   22    Se   3    Jess   F    4.0          n
3   20     J   5    Remi   F    3.5          y
4   20     J   6    Matt   M    3.0          n
[5 rows x 7 columns]

>>> # SELECT GPA, Grade FROM otherInfo FULL OUTER JOIN mathInfo ON otherInfo.ID = mathInfo.ID
>>> pd.merge(otherInfo, mathInfo, on='ID', how='outer')[['GPA', 'Grade']]
   GPA  Grade
0  3.8    4.0
1  3.5    3.0
2  3.0    NaN
3  3.9    4.0
4  2.8    NaN
5  2.9    3.5
6  3.8    3.0
7  3.4    NaN
8  3.7    NaN
[9 rows x 2 columns]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Using a join operation, create a \li{DataFrame} containing the ID, age, and GPA of all male individuals.
You ought to be able to accomplish this in one line of code.
\end{problem}

\begin{comment}
This may be going into too much detail for an introductory lab...
It is sometimes desirable to join to DataFrames on their indexes rather than on a particular column.
The \li{join} method makes this operation convenient.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> #create new DataFrame
>>> sibs = [0, 1, 0, 5, 2, 9]
>>> sibInfo = pd.DataFrame({'Siblings':sibs})
>>> sibInfo
   Siblings
0         0
1         1
2         0
3         5
4         2
5         9
[6 rows x 1 columns]

>>> #now join studentInfo with sibInfo
>>> studentInfo.join(sibInfo)
   Age Class  ID    Name Sex  Siblings
0   20    Sp   0    Mylan   M         0
1   21    Se   1   Regan   F         1
2   18    Fr   2     Justin   M         0
3   22    Se   3   Jess   F         5
4   19    Sp   4     Jason   M         2
5   20     J   5  Remi   F         9
6   20     J   6   Matt   M       NaN
7   19     J   7  Alexander   M       NaN
8   20    Se   8     JeanMarie   F       NaN
[9 rows x 6 columns]
\end{lstlisting}
The default is a left join, but this can be altered.
When attempting to join to DataFrames that share common columns on their indexes,
we must rename the columns to avoid contradictions.
We do this by simply appending
characters to the existing column names, specified by the \li{lsuffix} and \li{rsuffix}
parameters (for the left and right DataFrames, respectively).
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> #join studentInfo and mathInfo on indexes
>>> studentInfo.join(mathInfo, lsuffix='_left', rsuffix='_right', how='inner')
   Age Class  ID_left   Name Sex  Grade  ID_right Math_Major
0   20    Sp        0   Mylan   M    4.0         0          y
1   21    Se        1  Regan   F    3.0         1          n
2   18    Fr        2    Justin   M    3.5         5          y
3   22    Se        3  Jess   F    3.0         6          n
4   19    Sp        4    Jason   M    4.0         3          n
[5 rows x 8 columns]
\end{lstlisting}

The final SQL-like operation we will discuss is the UNION, or concatenation of DataFrames.
In the simplest setting, this operation is useful when we have two DataFrames that have the
same columns but possibly different rows.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> #create another df holding more math info
>>> mathID2 = [0, 5, 2, 4]
>>> mathGd2 = [4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0]
>>> major2 = ['y', 'y', 'n', 'y']
>>> mathInfo2 = pd.DataFrame({'Grade':mathGd2, 'ID':mathID2, 'Math_Major':major2})
>>> pd.concat([mathInfo, mathInfo2], ignore_index=True).drop_duplicates()
   Grade  ID Math_Major
0    4.0   0          y
1    3.0   1          n
2    3.5   5          y
3    3.0   6          n
4    4.0   3          n
7    2.0   2          n
8    3.0   4          y
[7 rows x 3 columns]
\end{lstlisting}
The \li{ignore_index=True} argument means we discard the indexes of the two input DataFrames and create
a new one for the concatenated DataFrame.
The \li{drop_duplicates} method simply drops duplicate rows.
\end{comment}

Be aware that other types of SQL-like operations are also possible, such as UNION.
When you find yourself unsure of how to carry out a more involved SQL-like operation, the online
pandas documentation will be of great service.

\section*{Analyzing Data}
Although pandas does not provide built-in support for heavy-duty statistical analysis of data, there
are nevertheless many features and functions that facilitate basic data manipulation and computation,
even when the data is in a somewhat messy state.
We will now explore some of these features.

\subsection*{Basic Data Manipulation}
Because the primary pandas data structures are subclasses of the \li{ndarray}, they are valid input
to most NumPy functions, and can often be treated simply as NumPy arrays.
For example, basic
vectorized operations work just fine:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> x = pd.Series(np.random.randn(4), index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
>>> y = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5), index=['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f'])
>>> x**2
a    1.710289
b    0.157482
c    0.540136
d    0.202580
dtype: float64
>>> z = x + y
>>> z
a    0.123877
b    0.278435
c         NaN
d   -1.318713
e         NaN
f         NaN
dtype: float64
>>> np.log(z)
a   -2.088469
b   -1.278570
c         NaN
d         NaN
e         NaN
f         NaN
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}
Notice that pandas automatically aligns the indexes when adding two \li{Series} (or \li{DataFrames}),
so that the the index of the output is simply the union of the indexes of the two inputs.
The default
missing value \li{NaN} is given for labels that are not shared by both inputs.

It may also be useful to transpose \li{DataFrames}, re-order the columns or rows, or sort according to a
given column.
Here we demonstrate these capabilities:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(4,2), index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], columns=['I', 'II'])
>>> df
          I        II
a -0.154878 -1.097156
b -0.948226  0.585780
c  0.433197 -0.493048
d -0.168612  0.999194

[4 rows x 2 columns]

>>> df.transpose()
           a         b         c         d
I  -0.154878 -0.948226  0.433197 -0.168612
II -1.097156  0.585780 -0.493048  0.999194

[2 rows x 4 columns]

>>> # switch order of columns, keep only rows 'a' and 'c'
>>> df.reindex(index=['a', 'c'], columns=['II', 'I'])
         II         I
a -1.097156 -0.154878
c -0.493048  0.433197

[2 rows x 2 columns]

>>> # sort descending according to column 'II'
>>> df.sort_values('II', ascending=False)
          I        II
d -0.168612  0.999194
b -0.948226  0.585780
c  0.433197 -0.493048
a -0.154878 -1.097156

[4 rows x 2 columns]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Basic Statistical Functions}

The pandas library allows us to easily calculate basic summary statistics of our data,
useful when we want a quick description of the data.
The \li{describe()} function
outputs several such summary statistics for each column in a \li{DataFrame}:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> df.describe()
              I        II
count  4.000000  4.000000
mean  -0.209630 -0.001308
std    0.566696  0.964083
min   -0.948226 -1.097156
25%   -0.363516 -0.644075
50%   -0.161745  0.046366
75%   -0.007859  0.689133
max    0.433197  0.999194

[8 rows x 2 columns]
\end{lstlisting}

Functions for calculating means and variances, the covariance and correlation matrices, and other
basic statistics are also available.
Below, we calculate the means of each row, as well as the
covariance matrix:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> df.mean(axis=1)
a   -0.626017
b   -0.181223
c   -0.029925
d    0.415291
dtype: float64

>>> df.cov()
           I        II
I   0.321144 -0.256229
II -0.256229  0.929456

[2 rows x 2 columns]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{comment}

\subsection*{Dealing with Missing Data} % -------------------------------------

Missing data is a ubiquitous problem in data science.
Fortunately, pandas is particularly well-suited to
handling missing and anomalous data.
As we have already seen, the pandas default for a missing value is \li{NaN}.
In basic arithmetic operations, if one of the operands is \li{NaN}, then the output is also \li{NaN}.
The following example illustrates this concept:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> x = pd.Series(np.arange(5))
>>> y = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5))
>>> x.iloc[3] = np.nan
>>> x + y
0    0.731521
1    0.623651
2    2.396344
3         NaN
4    3.351182
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}

If we are not interested in the missing values, we can simply drop them from the data altogether:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> (x + y).dropna()
0    0.731521
1    0.623651
2    2.396344
4    3.351182
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}

This is not always the desired behavior, however.
It may well be the case that missing data actually corresponds to
some default value, such as zero.
In this case, we can replace all instances of \li{NaN} with a specified value:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> # fill missing data with 0, add
>>> x.fillna(0) + y
0    0.731521
1    0.623651
2    2.396344
3    1.829400
4    3.351182
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}

Other functions, such as \li{<<sum()>>} and \li{mean()} ignore NaN values in the computation.
When dealing with missing data, make sure you are aware of the behavior of the pandas functions you are using.

\section*{Data I/O} % =========================================================

Being able to import and export data is a fundamental skill in data science.
Unfortunately, with the multitude of data formats and conventions, importing data can often be a painful task.
The pandas library seeks to reduce some of the difficulty by providing file readers for various types of formats,
including CSV, Excel, HDF5, SQL, JSON, HTML, and pickle files.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
Method & Description \\ \hline
\li{describe()}  & Return a \li{Series} describing the data structure \\
\li{head()}      & Return the first $n$ rows, defaulting to 5 \\
\li{tail()}      & Return the last $n$ rows, defaulting to 5 \\
\li{to_csv()}    & Write the index and entries to a CSV file \\
\li{to_json()}   & Convert the object to a JSON string \\
\li{to_pickle()} & Serialize the object and store it in an external file \\
\li{to_sql()}    & Write the object data to an open SQL database \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Methods for viewing or exporting data in a pandas \li{Series} or \li{DataFrame}.}
\label{table:pandas-view-or-export}
\end{table}

The CSV (comma separated values) format is a simple way of storing tabular data
in plain text.
Because CSV files are one of the most popular file formats for
exchanging data, we will explore the \li{read_csv()} function in more detail.
To learn to read other types of file formats, see the online pandas
documentation.
To read a CSV data file into a \li{DataFrame}, call the
\li{read_csv()} function with the path to the CSV file, along with the
appropriate keyword arguments.
Below we list some of the most important keyword
arguments:
\begin{itemize}
\item \li{delimiter}:
This argument specifies the character that separates data fields, often a
comma or a whitespace character.

\item \li{header}:
The row number (starting at 0) in the CSV file that contains the column names.

\item \li{index_col}:
If you want to use one of the columns in the CSV file as the index for the
\li{DataFrame}, set this argument to the desired column number.

\item \li{skiprows}:
If an integer $n$, skip the first $n$ rows of the file, and then start reading
in the data.
If a list of integers, skip the specified rows.

\item \li{names}:
If the CSV file does not contain the column names, or you wish to use other
column names, specify them in a list assigned to this argument.

\end{itemize}
There are several other keyword arguments, but this should be enough to get you
started.

When you need to save your data, pandas allows you to write to several different
file formats.
A typical example is the \li{to_csv()} function method attached to
\li{Series} and \li{DataFrame} objects, which writes the data to a CSV file.
Keyword arguments allow you to specify the separator character, omit writing the
columns names or index, and specify many other options.
The code below
demonstrates its typical usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> df.to_csv("my_df.csv")
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem} % Crime data.
The file \texttt{crime\_data.csv} contains data on types of crimes committed in the United States from 1960 to 2016.
\begin{itemize}
\item Load the data into a pandas \li{DataFrame}, using the column names in the file and the column titled
``Year'' as the index.
Make sure to skip lines that don't contain data.

\item Insert a new column into the data frame that contains the crime rate by year (the ratio of ``Total'' column
to the ``Population'' column).

\item Plot the crime rate as a function of the year.

\item List the 5 years with the highest crime rate in descending order.

\item Calculate the average number of total crimes as well as burglary crimes between 1960 and 2012.

\item Find the years for which the total number of crimes was below average, but the number of burglaries
was above average.

\item Plot the number of murders as a function of the population.

\item Select the Population, Violent, and Robbery columns for all years in the 1980s, and save
this smaller data frame to a CSV file \texttt{crime\_subset.csv}.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
In 1912 the RMS \emph{Titanic} sank after colliding with an iceberg.
The file \texttt{titanic.csv} contains data on the incident.
Each row represents a different passenger, and the columns describe various features of the passengers (age, sex, whether or not they survived, etc.)

Start by cleaning the data.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read the data into a \li{DataFrame}.
    Use the first row of the file as the column labels, but do not use any of the columns as the index.
    \item Drop the columns \li{"Sibsp"}, \li{"Parch"}, \li{"Cabin"}, \li{"Boat"}, \li{"Body"}, and \li{"home.dest"}.
    \item Drop any entries without data in the \li{"Survived"} column, then change the remaining entries to \li{True} or \li{False} (they start as 1 or 0).
    \item Replace null entries in the \li{"Age"} column with the average age.
    \item Save the new \li{DataFrame} as \texttt{titanic\_clean.csv}.
\end{itemize}
Next, answer the following questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item How many people survived? What percentage of passengers survived?
    \item What was the average price of a ticket? How much did the most expensive ticket cost?
    \item How old was the oldest survivor? How young was the youngest survivor? What about non-survivors?
\end{itemize}



\end{problem}
